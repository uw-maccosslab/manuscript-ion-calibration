This repo contains most of the input files and the basic analyses used in the manuscript "Evaluation of an Orbitrap Astral Zoom mass spectrometer prototype for quantitative proteomics - beyond identification lists", which is currently located on bioRxiv under the DOI [10.1101/2025.05.30.657132](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.30.657132). Any files not located here are freely and openly accessible on the [Ion calibration manuscript page of PanoramaWeb](https://panoramaweb.org/MacCoss_ModifiedOrbitrapAstralZoom.url).

Data was exported using the Skyline document grid. Many of the Skyline documents were created using pivot tables. Analyses were perfomed using Skyline and R Markdown files.

### Repository Layout
